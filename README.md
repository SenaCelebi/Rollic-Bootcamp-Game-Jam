# Rollic Bootcamp Game Jam

This game jam was organized by Rollic in its hyper-casual mobile game development [bootcamp](https://www.patika.dev/bootcamp/hyper-casual-mobile-game-art-development-bootcamp). Couple or chance concepts were determined as the theme for the games to be developed. Inspired by these themes, each team developed their own hypercasual game by using Unity 3D.

## Game Idea

We wanted to create a store where people could design their ideal match. As an employee of this store, your job is to design the desired perfect wife or husband. Customers will tell you the features of their perfect match, but sometimes they forget to mention some features. In this case, your task is to design the match according to the desired features and make it perfect. For features that are not mentioned, you should leave up to chance.
